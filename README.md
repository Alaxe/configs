#About
Configs is a repository with some of the configs i use on my linux machine.
You should be able to install it all using `setup`, or just configure a 
specific program using `<program_name>/setup` e.g. `vim/setup`.
Note that `setup` also installs all needed packages, which
are listed in `packages.txt`
#Included software
This is the software for which I have uploaded the configs
 * vim
 * i3
 * ncmpcpp + mpd(visualization)
